# Session 2

## Topics covered
*What topics were covered in this session*

* Finished the history of computers
* Setting up git for windows

## Personal Notes and research following this session
*Which class sessions and personal research refers to technology in this proposal. Link to examples.*

* To access the git folder I have locally through git would be "cd C:\Gitrepos"
* To check which folder I'm in, I input "pwd" and then it just displays it
* To access the Computing foundation folder through git would be " cd COM304_Foundation_1/"
* Small tip: You can autocomplete the destination if the path name is unique enough by pressing TAB (thanks craig)
* To update igni (I'll just call them igni (my laptop) and pheas (the web version) from now on) with changes I made on pheas, I ave to make sure that I'm in the right folder, and then input "git pull", which will pull all changes i made on pheas into igni.

__Research__
* I believe "cd" is used to refer to "Change Directory", so whenever I say "cd C:\Gitrepos", I'm telling git to change my directory to "Gitrepos" in my C drive
Apparently, there's varyations to this command, such as 
* "cd .." to go up one directory level
* "cd ~" to go to the home directory
* "cd /" to go to the root directory
* "cd" by itself also goes back to the home directory
