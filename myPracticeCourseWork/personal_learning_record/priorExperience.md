# Prior Experience

---
**NOTE**

# Describe your past experience of computing. 
* I've made a few small games on the side out of boredom (versions of simple games like snake and flappy bird), and I'm fairly decent with languages like c#, c++, python and a little (very little) javascript.
* My interest in computers and computer science origninated from games back in 2014, how I would always sneak onto my father's computer to play random flash games I found online: sometimes I'd even drag my siblings and cousins into it. Eventually I became really unsatisfied with the free games I could find online, so I decided to try and make my own on scratch, looking up youtube tutorials that I barely understood at the time, but I still learnt from. After a while, I had churned out a few platformer games on scratch, but they often had problems I didn't know how to solve so I went back to playing those random free games. Fast forward to 2019, I joined a coding club at my secondary school, which reignited my love for game development, and computing in general. From there I attended game jams, a hackathon (I didn't get very far in that one, but I did learn a bit) and various other computer related events to deepen my knowledge, which has led me to wanting to obtain a degree in something that has to do with computers.
# What do you know and what would you like to learn from this module?
* ~~How to apply these skills I've learnt to more practical situations, and how to make money from it.~~ While I learnt a lot of things over the years to do with computers, I've never had the confidence to start using that knowledge to secure my future because I've always deaded heading down a path I can't go back from. That indecisiveness is the reason I ended up here, and I want to change that. Through this course, I want to be able to pick a path for myself that I wont regret.
