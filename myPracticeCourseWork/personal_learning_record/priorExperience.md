# Prior Experience

---
**NOTE**

# Describe your past experience of computing. 
* I've made a few small games on the side out of boredom (versions of simple games like snake and flappy bird), and I'm farily decent with languages like c#, c++, python and a little (very little) javascript.
# What do you know and what would you like to learn from this module?
* How to apply these skills I've learnt to more practical situations, and how to make money from it.
